    <h3>Harkins Theatre</h3>

    <picture><img src="images/harkins.jpg" alt="Harkins Theatre website front page"></picture>
    <p>When you visit the Harkins theatre website, immediately the first thing you see is a 
        display of a new movie that is showing. This display switches between the new movies 
        showing giving the ad for the movie bout 5 seconds on display before flipping to another movie.
        right below this is a section that shows upcoming movies. This is a good example of visual heirachy
        because your eyes are first drawn to thhe newly released popular movies and then to the upcoing movies
        which is a good way to get an individual interested in wha harkins is showing and is going to show.</p>

    <p>On youtubes webite it immediatly displays an explore page where you can easily navigate between what
        kind of videos you are looking for. It also squeezs about three different options for shorts right
        underneath the explore bar, as well as an option for a video to watch. With the way this is set up, a user 
        could quickly hop right into watching a short or any kind of video they may want.

    <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
    <h3>Amazon</h3>
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a>
    <picture><img src="images/amazon.jpg" alt="Amazon website front page"></picture>
    <p>Amazons page is a great example of white space and clean design because the website is full of places to 
        start exploring but leaves a white space for the user to have the option to sign in. This creates an effect
        where the page is not overwhelming with colors and products. This allows the user to easily navigate to where to 
        sign in at. This also creates a divide between the top of the page where it has navigation elements and user profile 
        elements, and the lower part of the page were it suggests new items for the user to look at.
